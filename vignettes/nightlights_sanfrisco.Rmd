Introduction

The following vignette is a case-study for the city of San Francisco in which we look whether the nightlight brightness is more in the areas around public housing than the non-public housing areas in the city.We do this by comparing the median brightness value at nighttime with public and non-public housing using the population grid developed using US Census data and building area calculated using the height of the buildings collected from the city of San Francisco website. Furthermore, we compare the public and non-public housing areas with a 10-year average radiance.

Data

The following datasets were used to do the analysis for San Francisco and all were projected to EPSG:3310 NAD83 / California Albers as it covers San Francisco county.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# San Francisco census tracts & outline
sanfrisco_pop_tract <- readRDS(here("data/sf_poptract.rds"))

# San Francisco public housing development areas & grid
sf_ph <- readRDS(here("data/sf_phpoly.rds"))
sf_ph_grid <- rast(here("data/sf_ph_coverage.tif"))[[1]]

# San Francisco buildings & grid
sanfrisco_bldg_grid <- rast(here("data/sf_bldg_grid.tif"))
sanfrisco_bldg <- readRDS(here("data/sf_buildings.RDS"))

# San Francisco population grid
sf_pop <- rast(here("data/sf_pop.tif"))[[1]] %>% project(.,"EPSG:3310")

# Nightlights data, monthly, monthly average over 10 years and 10 year average
sf_nlights <- rast(here("data/SF_nightlights.tif"))
sf_nlight_mo <- rast(here("data/SF_nightlights_mean_month.tif"))
sf_nlight_lt <- rast(here("data/SF_nightlights_mean.tif")) %>% project(.,"EPSG:3310")
names(sf_nlight_lt) <- "brightness"
sf_nl_dates <- readRDS(here("data/SF_nightlight_dates.rds"))
```

For San Francisco, I developed a geocoded dataset using public housing data from San Francisco Housing Authority.Based on this data, the total number of public housing projects came down to 179 as can be seen below.

#Public housing
```{r}
sf_phplt <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sanfrisco_pop_tract, col = alpha("grey7", 0.3), fill = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = sf_ph, aes(fill = ''), col = "blue", 
          show.legend = "polygon") +
  labs(fill = "Public Housing Development in San Francisco") + 
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9)) 
ggsave(sf_phplt, file = here("vignettes/figures/sf_housing.png"), 
       height = 7, width = 10, dpi = 72)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/sf_housing.png"))
```


The average brightness of nightlights in San Francisco for the ten-year period from 2012 to 2021.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sf_nlplt <- ggplot(as.data.frame(sf_nlight_lt, xy = TRUE)) + 
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = brightness)) +
  geom_sf(data = sanfrisco_pop_tract %>% st_transform(crs = 3310), fill = "transparent", 
          col = "yellow", size = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_distiller(
    guide = guide_colorbar(ticks = FALSE),
    type = "seq", direction = -1, palette = "Greys"
  ) + xlab('') + ylab('') + theme_void()
ggsave(sf_nlplt, file = here("vignettes/figures/sf_ltnl.png"), 
       height = 7, width = 10, dpi = 72, bg = "grey")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/sf_ltnl.png"))
```


Next, we will see the grid datasets developed for public housing percentage, population, and building structure. 

```{r}
#Use of test variable to make the extent for all the variables same and for masking
test <- read_sf(here::here("TEST_safran_poptract.geojson")) %>% 
  st_transform("EPSG:3310")

sf_nightlight <- sf_nlight_lt %>% crop(test)
sf_ph_grid <- sf_ph_grid %>% crop(test)
sanfrisco_bldg_grid <- sanfrisco_bldg_grid %>%  crop(test) %>% mask(test)
sf_pop <- sf_pop %>% crop(test) %>%  mask (test)
sf_rs <- c(sf_ph_grid * 100, sanfrisco_bldg_grid$area_sqm, sf_pop,    mask(sf_nightlight, test))

names(sf_rs) <- c("ph", "area_sqm", "population", 
               "radiance")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("vignettes/figures/sf_gridstack1.png"))
par(oma=c(0,0,0,3))
sf_stackplt <- plot(sf_rs, nc = 2, axes = FALSE,
     main = c("% Public housing", "Building Area (SqM)", "Population", 
              "Nighttime radiance"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/sf_gridstack1.png"))
```
Now, we are going to build the population and building quantile together with public housing, assign the population and area quantiles to each cell. Following this, we will create a quantiles table of population and area.

```{r}
sf_dat <- as_tibble(as.data.frame(sf_rs, cells = TRUE)) %>% na.omit(.)
# Population and building quantiles with public housing
pop_quantiles <- sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  pull(population) %>% quantile(.)
sf_dat <- sf_dat %>% mutate(area_sqm = as.integer(area_sqm))
area_quantiles <- sf_dat %>% pull(area_sqm) %>% quantile(.)

# Assigning quantiles to each cell
poparea <- sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_class = cut(population, pop_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 4)) %>% 
  mutate(., barea_class = cut(area_sqm, area_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 6))

# Creating new quantiles table of population and area

ctab <- table(pop = poparea$pop_class, barea = poparea$barea_class) %>% 
  as.data.frame(.) %>% 
  separate(., col = pop, into = c("pop_lower", "pop_upper"), sep = ",") %>% 
  separate(., col = barea, into = c("barea_lower", "barea_upper"), sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(., pop_lower = as.numeric(gsub('\\[|\\(', '', pop_lower))) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", pop_upper))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_lower = as.numeric(gsub("\\(|\\[", "", barea_lower))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", barea_upper))) %>%
  filter(., Freq > 1)
```

Based on the levels, pixels in the public housing grid are then classified into public housing and non-public housing development groups and then each of them are respectively assigned to their building structure and population levels. Finally, the results are combined back to a single tibble.

```{r}
# Filtering pixels with no public housing with the different combination of population and building area quantiles
no_ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  sf_dat %>% filter(ph == 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Non public housing")
}) %>% bind_rows()

# Filtering pixels with public housing  
ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Public housing")
  }) %>% bind_rows()

# Combining into single tibble 
combined <- bind_rows(ph_dat, no_ph_dat)
```
# Analysis

### What is the relationship between public housing areas and brightness?

For this we are going to make a regression plot using public housing areas (in %) as x-axis and nightlight radiance as y-axis. 
 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height= 7, fig.width= 7, eval=FALSE}
regressplt <- sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = ph, y = radiance)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = ph, y = radiance), method = "lm") + 
  xlab("% public housing") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1")
ggsave(regressplt,file = here("vignettes/figures/sf_regression.png"), height = 5, width = 5)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height= 3, fig.width= 3}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/sf_regression.png"))
```
The regression plot shows variability but there are outliers as well which have significant leverage that can incorrectly result in showing the stronger. correlation Still it can be said broadly that with increasing proportion of public housing in an area, there seems to be some increase in brightness. However, there can be other factors responsible for this relationship like population (public housing has more people living per sq.m) or building structure.

Still, it is useful to calculate the r-squared value to quantify the relationship.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
rg_model <-  lm(formula = radiance ~ ph, data = sf_dat)
summary(rg_model)$r.squared
```
The r-squared value show a weak relationship between proportion of public housing and radiance.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
bxplt <- ggplot(combined) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Level, y = radiance, fill = Group)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('gold', 'black')) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c('gold', 'black'), 0.3)) +
  xlab("Population/Building Area Class") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1") +
  theme_linedraw()
ggsave(bxplt, file = here("vignettes/figures/sf_ltmean_boxplot.png"), 
       height = 7, width = 10, dpi = 72, bg = "grey")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/sf_ltmean_boxplot.png"))
```

We can see in the box plots that 3 of the 9 population/building area classes show public housing pixels to be more brightly lit than those without public housing. The following table shows the median brightness for the public housing and non-public housing groups and the median difference in brightness. Here we can see that most areas in San Francisco with public housing developments are not more brightly lit than areas without public housing.

```{r, message=FALSE}
rad_stats <- combined %>%
  group_by(Group, Level) %>% 
  summarize(Radiance = median(radiance)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = Radiance) %>% 
  mutate(Difference = `Public housing` - `Non public housing`)

knitr::kable(rad_stats, digits = 0)
```



```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sf_nlight_winter <- sf_nlight_mo %>% subset(c(12, 1, 2)) %>% mean() %>% project(.,"EPSG:3310")
names(sf_nlight_winter) <- 'radiance'
sf_nlight_winter <- sf_nlight_winter %>% crop(test)

rs_mo <- c(sf_ph_grid * 100, sanfrisco_bldg_grid$area_sqm, sf_pop, mask(sf_nlight_winter, sf_pop))
names(rs_mo) <- c("ph", "area_sqm", "population", 
               "radiance")
sf_dat <- as_tibble(as.data.frame(rs_mo, cells = TRUE)) %>% mutate(area_sqm = as.integer(area_sqm)) %>% na.omit(.)

pop_quantiles_mo <- sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  pull(population) %>% quantile(.)
area_quantiles <- sf_dat %>% pull(area_sqm) %>% quantile(.)

# Assigning quantile to each cell
poparea <- sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_class = cut(population, pop_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 4)) %>% 
  mutate(., barea_class = cut(area_sqm, area_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 6))

# Create new table with quantiles of pop and area 

ctab <- table(pop = poparea$pop_class, barea = poparea$barea_class) %>% 
  as.data.frame(.) %>% 
  separate(., col = pop, into = c("pop_lower", "pop_upper"), sep = ",") %>% 
  separate(., col = barea, into = c("barea_lower", "barea_upper"), sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(., pop_lower = as.numeric(gsub('\\[|\\(', '', pop_lower))) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", pop_upper))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_lower = as.numeric(gsub("\\(|\\[", "", barea_lower))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", barea_upper))) %>%
  filter(., Freq > 1)
# Filtering pixels with no public housing with the different combination of population and building area quantiles
no_ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  sf_dat %>% filter(ph == 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Non public housing")
}) %>% bind_rows()

# Filtering pixels with public housing into similar categories 
ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  sf_dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Public housing")
  }) %>% bind_rows()

# Combining data into a single tibble 
combined <- bind_rows(ph_dat, no_ph_dat)
```



Median Difference of Public Housing and Non-Public Housing NightLights for the three months period between December and February.
```{r}
rad_stats <- combined %>%
  group_by(Group, Level) %>% 
  summarize(Radiance = median(radiance)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = Radiance) %>% 
  mutate(Difference = `Public housing` - `Non public housing`)

knitr::kable(rad_stats, digits = 0)

```

There are some differences but the overall trend remains the same even when we consider three months. Even now, there are 3 out of 9 areas where public housing is more brightly lit than non-public housing.
