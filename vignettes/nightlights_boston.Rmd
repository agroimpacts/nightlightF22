This vignette covers the analysis of the Boston case study. In it, median nighttime brightness is compared in areas with and without public housing in Boston with similar building structure and population by using gridded datasets of population from US Census data and building area in square meters as an estimate for living space. In addition to looking at the 10-year average radiance, we also compare radiance using the average of the brightest months in Boston- December through February.

In Boston, there were 53 public housing developments, shown in the map below:

Here, we can also see the average brightness of Boston nightlights between the years 2012 - and 2021.

To first see if there is any relationship between public housing and nighttime lighting overall in Boston, a simple linear regression is run to compare the change in radiance against increasing percentages of public housing in each nightlights pixel. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
regressplt <- dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = ph, y = radiance)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = ph, y = radiance), method = "lm") + 
  xlab("% public housing") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1")
ggsave(regressplt,file = here("vignettes/figures/regression.png"),
       width = 10, dpi = 72)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/regression.png"))
```

The plot shows a large amount of variability as well as an outlier that is likely making the trend appear stronger than it may be. Overall though, it reflects an increase in brightness as the proportion of public housing in a grid cell increases. However, the regression does not account for differences in the building structures and population across the city that might be influencing factors on nighttime radiance. To see whether areas with public housing are more brightly lit than areas without public housing, we need to control for population and total building area.  


# Long-Term Average
The following figure is a box plot comparing areas in Boston with public housing to those without but that have similar building structure and population. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
bxplt <- ggplot(combined) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Level, y = radiance, fill = Group)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red', 'blue')) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c('red', 'blue'), 0.3)) +
  xlab("Population/Building Area Class") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1") +
  theme_linedraw()
ggsave(bxplt, file = here("vignettes/figures/bstn_ltmean_boxplot.png"), 
       height = 4, width = 10, dpi = 72)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/bstn_ltmean_boxplot.png"))
```
We can see in the box plots that 7 of the 11 population/building area classes show pixels containing public housing are more brightly lit than those without public housing. The following table shows the median brightness for the public housing and non-public housing groups and the median difference in brightness. Here we can see that areas in Boston with public housing developments are largely more brightly lit than areas without public housing. Of the 4 areas where that trend does not hold up, 2 of them, the Level 3 and 4 groupings, have a fairly small median difference.

```{r, message=FALSE}
rad_stats <- combined %>%
  group_by(Group, Level) %>% 
  summarize(Radiance = median(radiance)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = Radiance) %>% 
  mutate('Median Difference' = `Public housing` - `No public housing`)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(rad_stats, digits = 0) %>% kableExtra::kable_minimal()
```


# Brightest Months

For the second part of the analysis, we look at just the brightest months in the time series. For Boston, this is the winter months from December through February, as shown in the monthly average plot below.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# obtain max and min values 
maxv <- max(minmax(nlight_mo))+1
minv <- min(minmax(nlight_mo))

png(here("vignettes/figures/bstn_monl.png"), height = 500, width = 800, 
    units = "px", pointsize = 18)
par(oma = c(0, 0, 0, 2))
plot(nlight_mo, range = c(minv, maxv), axes = FALSE, smooth = TRUE)
dev.off()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/bstn_monl.png"))
```


```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nlight_winter <- nlight_mo %>% subset(c(12, 1, 2)) %>% mean()
names(nlight_winter) <- 'radiance'
rs_mo <- c(bstn_ph_grid * 100, bstn_bldg_grid$area_sqm, bstn_pop, mask(nlight_winter, bstn_pop))

# Assign quantile to each cell with public housing
poparea <- dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_class = cut(population, pop_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 4)) %>% 
  mutate(., barea_class = cut(area_sqm, area_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 6))

# Create new table with quantiles of pop and area as x & y

  as.data.frame(.) %>%

  filter(., Freq > 1)
# Select pixels with no public housing within the different combination
# of population and building area quantiles
no_ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  dat %>% filter(ph == 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "No public housing")
}) %>% bind_rows()

# Select pixels with public housing into the same categories 
ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Public housing")
  }) %>% bind_rows()

# combine into single table 
combined <- bind_rows(ph_dat, no_ph_dat)
```

Looking at the resulting box plots and comparison table below, there appears to be some accentuated differences in brightness between areas with and without public housing, however the overall trend remains the same as the long-term average brightness results.
```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(combined) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Level, y = radiance, fill = Group)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red', 'blue')) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c('red', 'blue'), 0.3)) +
  xlab("Population/Building Area Class") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1") +
  theme_linedraw()
ggsave(p, file = here("vignettes/figures/bstn_momean_bxplt.png"), 
       height = 4, width = 10, dpi = 72)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/bstn_momean_bxplt.png"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rad_stats <- combined %>%
  group_by(Group, Level) %>% 
  summarize(Radiance = median(radiance)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = Radiance) %>% 
  mutate(Difference = `Public housing` - `No public housing`)

knitr::kable(rad_stats, digits = 0) %>% kableExtra::kable_minimal()
```
