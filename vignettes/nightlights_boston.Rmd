# Introduction
Increasing nighttime lighting (also referred to as street lighting) is a tool used be police as a strategy for reducing crime across. We have seen historical examples of this such as Boston’s Operation Night Light in the mid-1990s^i^ and a plan in London to install over 3000 street lights in the 1980s^ii^  as well as contemporary initiatives such as floodlights installed by the New York Police Department in NYC in 2015^iii^  and Dallas’ 2021 public safety plan that includes the installation of new street lights.^iv^  Despite this being a popular tool used by police departments, the evidence around the impact of street lighting on crime prevention is highly mixed and there are several studies which suggest that increased nighttime lights has no impact and, in come cases, even increases crime.^v^

This project is a follow-on to a proof-of-concept project looking at the feasibility of detecting police surveillance floodlights in New York City using the NASA Black Marble nighttime lights products. In our effort to further expand on this work, we look at two new case studies—Boston and San Francisco—to explore the relationship between nighttime radiance and the presence of public housing in the two study areas. Our aim is to find whether neighborhoods with public housing are more brightly lit than those neighborhoods with non-public housing in Boston and San Francisco between 2012-2020. The overall project objectives are to:

1. Evaluate any correlation between brightly lit neighborhoods and neighborhoods with public housing across our two study areas.
2. Further assess the feasibility of nightlight imagery to find differences of excessively lit neighborhood and those which are not, building on the New York City study. 

This vignette covers the analysis of the Boston case study. In it, median nighttime brightness is compared in areas with and without public housing in Boston with similar building structure and population by using gridded datasets of population from US Census data and building area in square meters as an estimate for living space. In addition to looking at the 10-year average radiance, we also compare radiance using the average of the brightest months in Boston- December through February. 

# Data & Methods
## Data

The following datasets are used in this case study:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
datasets <- read.csv(here("data/boston_datasets.csv"))
kable(datasets, col.names = c("Data", "Source", "Description")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_minimal()
```
All data were projected into the NAD83 - Massachusetts Mainland ESPG:26986 coordinate system. 
```{r}
# Boston Census tracts & outline
bstntract <- readRDS(here("data/bstn_tract.rds"))

# Boston public housing developments & grid
bstn_ph <- readRDS(here("data/bstn_phpoly.rds"))
bstn_ph_grid <- rast(here("data/bstn_ph_coverage.tif"))[[1]]

# Boston buildings & grid
bstn_bldg_grid <- rast(here("data/bstn_bldg_grid.tif"))
bstn_bldg <- readRDS(here("data/bstn_bldg.rds"))

# Boston population grid
bstn_pop <- rast(here("data/bstn_pop.tif"))[[1]]

# Nightlights data, monthly, average for each month over 10 years, 10 year mean
nlights <- rast(here("data/Boston_nightlights.tif"))
nlight_mo <- rast(here("data/Boston_nightlights_mean_month.tif"))
nlight_lt <- rast(here("data/Boston_nightlights_mean.tif"))
names(nlight_lt) <- "brightness"
nl_dates <- readRDS(here("data/Boston_nightlight_dates.rds"))
```

## Methods
The methods can be split into roughly 3 sections: data pre-processing, grouping areas in Boston with similar building structure and population, and comparing the median difference in nighttime radiance in areas with and without public housing. For the pre-processing, the nightlight data were first transformed from h5 files to geotiffs using a python script (see [transformhd5_debugged.py notebook](https://github.com/agroimpacts/nightlightF22/blob/33dd7a3f674f5abf85627a9158e6b53f8e4d9d3b/notebooks/transformhd5_debugged.py) for script and the monthly and long-term means were calculated and saved as Spatial Raster objects (see [nightlights_processing.R notebook](https://github.com/agroimpacts/nightlightF22/blob/33dd7a3f674f5abf85627a9158e6b53f8e4d9d3b/notebooks/nightlights_processing.R) for script).

Here, we can see the average brightness of Boston nightlights between the years 2012 - and 2021. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
nlplt <- ggplot(as.data.frame(nlight_lt, xy = TRUE)) + 
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = brightness)) +
  geom_sf(data = bstntract %>% st_transform(crs = 4326), fill = "transparent", 
          col = "yellow", size = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_distiller(
    guide = guide_colorbar(ticks = FALSE),
    type = "seq", direction = -1, palette = "Greys"
  ) + xlab('') + ylab('') + theme_void()
ggsave(nlplt, file = here("vignettes/figures/bstn_ltnl.png"), 
       height = 7, width = 10, dpi = 72, bg = "grey")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/bstn_ltnl.png"))
```


Next, gridded datasets were created for public housing percentage, population, and building structure. For all three, empty rasters were created, matching the properties to the nightlight data and then masked to Boston. For public housing, the fraction of public housing developments within each pixel was calculated to get a dataset. For population, the grid was intersected with census tracts and the population within each intersected area was calculated. Finally, the square area of buildings from the building footprint dataset was used to approximate living space so, similar to the population grid, the building footprints were intersected with the grid and the total square area in each intersected area was calculated. Scripts for this step can be found here: [boston_pop_grid.R]( https://github.com/agroimpacts/nightlightF22/blob/33dd7a3f674f5abf85627a9158e6b53f8e4d9d3b/notebooks/boston_pop_grid.R) and [bstn_building_grid.R]( https://github.com/agroimpacts/nightlightF22/blob/33dd7a3f674f5abf85627a9158e6b53f8e4d9d3b/notebooks/bstn_building_grid.R). 


In order to compare areas with similar building structure and populations with and without public housing, we will use the gridded public housing coverage data combined with the gridded datasets for population and estimated square meters of buildings in Boston, which provides an estimate of the living space and structure of the city's built environment.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
rs <- c(bstn_ph_grid * 100, bstn_bldg_grid$area_sqm, bstn_pop, mask(nlight_lt, bstn_pop))
names(rs) <- c("ph", "area_sqm", "population", 
               "radiance")
par(oma=c(0,0,0,3))
plot(rs, nc = 2, axes = FALSE,
     main = c("% Public housing", "Building Area (SqM)", "Population", 
              "Nighttime radiance"))
```

# Analysis

### What is the relationship between public housing and brightness?
To first see if there is any relationship between public housing and nighttime lighting overall in Boston, we start with a linear regression to compare the change in radiance against increasing percentages of public housing in each nightlights pixel. 

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=7}
dat <- as_tibble(as.data.frame(rs, cells = TRUE)) %>% na.omit(.)
dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = ph, y = radiance)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = ph, y = radiance), method = "lm") + 
  xlab("% public housing") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1")
```

The plot shows a large amount of variability, but an overall increase in brightness as the proportion of public housing in a grid cell increases. However, the regression does not account for differences in the building structures and population across the city that might be influencing factors on nighttime radiance. To see whether areas with public housing are more brightly lit than areas without public housing, we need to control for population and building square meters.  

### Comparing areas with similar structure and population

Ideally, we would compare similar areas based on pixel percentage of public housing, building structure, and population. However, our public housing grid shows that there is only a very small range of percentage of public housing across Boston (0-3.5%) so we will just group like areas in terms of building structure and population and compare just those groupings that have public housing and that don't.

To group pixels with and without public housing in them according to levels defined by differing percentiles of building volume and population, we first create a cross-tabulation of the quantiles for both population and building area.

```{r}
# Get quantiles of population and building volume in pixels with public housing
pop_quantiles <- dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  pull(population) %>% quantile(.)
area_quantiles <- dat %>% pull(area_sqm) %>% quantile(.)

# Assign quantile to each cell with public housing
poparea <- dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_class = cut(population, pop_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 4)) %>% 
  mutate(., barea_class = cut(area_sqm, area_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 6))

# Create new table with quantiles of pop and area as x & y
# showing count of each pixel for each combination of quantiles
# Drop () & [] special characters from each column
ctab <- table(pop = poparea$pop_class, barea = poparea$barea_class) %>% 
  as.data.frame(.) %>% 
  separate(., col = pop, into = c("pop_lower", "pop_upper"), sep = ",") %>% 
  separate(., col = barea, into = c("barea_lower", "barea_upper"), sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(., pop_lower = as.numeric(gsub('\\[|\\(', '', pop_lower))) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", pop_upper))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_lower = as.numeric(gsub("\\(|\\[", "", barea_lower))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", barea_upper))) %>%
  filter(., Freq > 1)
```

Now, we will group pixels with and without public housing into the combination of population and building area quantiles.
```{r}
# Select pixels with no public housing within the different combination
# of population and building area quantiles
no_ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  dat %>% filter(ph == 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "No public housing")
}) %>% bind_rows()

# Select pixels with public housing into the same categories 
ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Public housing")
  }) %>% bind_rows()

# combine into single table 
combined <- bind_rows(ph_dat, no_ph_dat)
```

Having prepared the data, we can now look at the differences using box plots to compare the differences between pixels with public housing to those that don't, grouped according to the population and building volume levels

```{r, fig.width=7}
p <- ggplot(combined) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Level, y = radiance, fill = Group)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red', 'blue')) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c('red', 'blue'), 0.3)) +
  xlab("Population/Building Area Class") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1") +
  theme_linedraw() #+
p
```
We can see in the box plots that 7 of the 11 population/building area classes show pixels containing public housing are more brightly lit than those without public housing.Let's calculate the averages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
rad_stats <- combined %>%
  group_by(Group, Level) %>% 
  summarize(Radiance = median(radiance)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = Radiance) %>% 
  mutate(Difference = `Public housing` - `No public housing`)

knitr::kable(rad_stats, digits = 0)
```

That compares the median difference between the two groups at each level, which shows some large brightness differences in each category.

What if we wanted to look at a subset of our time series data and just look at the months with highest brightness? In Boston, December, January, and February have the highest long-term radiance. We can average those three months and run the same analysis as before.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nlight_winter <- nlight_mo %>% subset(c(12, 1, 2)) %>% mean()
names(nlight_winter) <- 'radiance'
rs <- c(bstn_ph_grid * 100, bstn_bldg_grid$area_sqm, bstn_pop, mask(nlight_winter, bstn_pop))
names(rs) <- c("ph", "area_sqm", "population", 
               "radiance")

# Get quantiles of population and building volume in pixels with public housing
pop_quantiles <- dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  pull(population) %>% quantile(.)
area_quantiles <- dat %>% pull(area_sqm) %>% quantile(.)

# Assign quantile to each cell with public housing
poparea <- dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_class = cut(population, pop_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 4)) %>% 
  mutate(., barea_class = cut(area_sqm, area_quantiles, include.lowest = TRUE, dig.lab = 6))

# Create new table with quantiles of pop and area as x & y
# showing count of each pixel for each combination of quantiles
# Drop () & [] special characters from each column
ctab <- table(pop = poparea$pop_class, barea = poparea$barea_class) %>% 
  as.data.frame(.) %>% 
  separate(., col = pop, into = c("pop_lower", "pop_upper"), sep = ",") %>% 
  separate(., col = barea, into = c("barea_lower", "barea_upper"), sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(., pop_lower = as.numeric(gsub('\\[|\\(', '', pop_lower))) %>% 
  mutate(., pop_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", pop_upper))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_lower = as.numeric(gsub("\\(|\\[", "", barea_lower))) %>%
  mutate(., barea_upper = as.numeric(gsub("\\]|\\)", "", barea_upper))) %>%
  filter(., Freq > 1)
# Select pixels with no public housing within the different combination
# of population and building area quantiles
no_ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  dat %>% filter(ph == 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "No public housing")
}) %>% bind_rows()

# Select pixels with public housing into the same categories 
ph_dat <- lapply(1:nrow(ctab), function(x) {   # x <- 1
  l <- ctab[x, ]
  dat %>% filter(ph > 0) %>% 
    filter(between(population, l$pop_lower, l$pop_upper)) %>% 
    filter(between(area_sqm, l$barea_lower, l$barea_upper)) %>% 
    mutate(Level = factor(x), Group = "Public housing")
  }) %>% bind_rows()

# combine into single table 
combined <- bind_rows(ph_dat, no_ph_dat)
```

Box-plots of Public-Housing and Non-Public Housing NightLights in December-February
```{r, fig.width=7}
p <- ggplot(combined) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Level, y = radiance, fill = Group)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red', 'blue')) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c('red', 'blue'), 0.3)) +
  xlab("Population/Building Area Class") + ylab("Radiance in nWatts·cm−2·sr−1") +
  theme_linedraw() #+
p
```

Median Difference of Public-Housing and Non-Public Housing NightLights in December-February
```{r}
rad_stats <- combined %>%
  group_by(Group, Level) %>% 
  summarize(Radiance = median(radiance)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = Radiance) %>% 
  mutate(Difference = `Public housing` - `No public housing`)

knitr::kable(rad_stats, digits = 0)
```

While we can see some more accentuated differences in brightness between areas with and without public housing, the overall trend remains the same.
